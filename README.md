# Score-Based Generative Models

This is a research project (UT Austin) advised by Dr. Jonathan Tamir on training and sampling using score-based based generative modeling for image reconstruction in various areas: MRI, Automotive Radars, Wireless Networks. The goal is to create a generic codebase that can support data from various domains.

The code is built on top of the official NCSNV2 implementation.
